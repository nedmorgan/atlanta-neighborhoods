# Atlanta Neighborhoods JSON

Here is a JSON file that lists all of the neighborhoods and current city council members for the city of Atlanta, GA. The Atlanta Neighborhoods JSON file includes the neighborhood name and NPU. The Atlanta Council Members JSON includes the relevant contact information for the president, members at-large, and district councilmembers.

I will do my best to update this information based on any new elections or other updatable criteria.
